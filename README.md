# Tic Tac Toe

## 📜 Backstory

In 2020, while South Africa was in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdown, I was in my final year of middle school.
My cousin, who was taking IT in high school, introduced me to the world of programming.

I was immediately hooked.
I spent countless afternoons debugging and dedicated my Sundays to sitting with my dad, piecing together the logic for this game.
It was my first ever project, built using **Delphi(Pascal)** - the standard in the South African school system.
This project didn't just result in a game; it sparked the passion for software development that I still carry to this day.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Delphi(pascal)
- **IDE:** RAD Studio / Delphi
- **Platform:** Windows VCL Application

## 🚀 Features

- **Two-Player Logic:** Classic X vs O gameplay.
- **Win Detection:** Hard-coded because I was a newbie.
